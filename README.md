# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

```
Concepts
```
For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

- [Python packages](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/66)
- [AirBnB clone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/74)

![AirBnB clone](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2018/6/65f4a1dd9c51265f49d0.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20230310%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230310T124943Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=4388b1671c31de16681aa6c6bd4c7889340622d664bae34458c76d5f6ccde4cd)

# Background Context

# Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

Before starting, please read the **AirBnB** concept page.

## First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the **AirBnB clone**. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration… 

Each task is linked and will help you to:

	. put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
	. create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
	. create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
	. create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage. 
	. create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

# What’s a command interpreter?

Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

	. Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
	. Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
	. Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
	. Update attributes of an object
	. Destroy an object

# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/),** without the help of Google**:


## General
        
	. How to create a Python package
	. How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
	. What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
	. How to serialize and deserialize a Class
	. How to write and read a JSON file
	. How to manage datetime
	. What is an UUID
	. What is *args and how to use it
	. What is **kwargs and how to use it
	. How to handle named arguments in a function

# Copyright - Plagiarism

	. You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
	. You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work. 
	. You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
	. Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

# Requirements

## Python Scripts

	. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	. All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
	. All your files should end with a new line
	. The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
	. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
	. Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
	. All your files must be executable
	. The length of your files will be tested using wc
	. All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
	. All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
	. All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
	. A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

## Python Unit Tests

	. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	. All your files should end with a new line
	. All your test files should be inside a folder tests
	. You have to use the [unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/unittest.html#module-unittest)
	. All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
	. All your test files and folders should start by test_
	. Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
	. e.g., For models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
	. e.g., For models/user.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_user.py
	. All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
	. You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
	. All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
	. All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
	. All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
	. We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

# GitHub

**There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.**

# More Info

## Execution

Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```
All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode: $ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash

```
0. README, AUTHORS 
```
	- Write a README.md: 
	- description of the project
		- how to start it
		- how to use it
		- examples
	- You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. For format, reference [Docker’s AUTHORS page](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/AUTHORS)
	- You should use branches and pull requests on GitHub - it will help you as team to organize your work
